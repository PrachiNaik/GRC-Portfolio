## Checklist for an "Agentic Workflow":

[ ] Data Provenance: Can we prove where the agent's training/RAG data came from?

[ ] Explainability: If the agent denies a customer's loan, can we pull the "Reasoning Trace" (Chain of Thought)?

[ ] Red Teaming: Has the agent been tested specifically for "jailbreaking" through tool-use?

[ ] Continuous Monitoring: Is there a "Drift Detection" system to alert us if the agent's behavior changes over time?
