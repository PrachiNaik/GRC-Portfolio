## 🛠️ The Agentic Trust Corp Tech Stack (Fictional)
- While this repository contains the core governance logic, in a production environment, I advocate for an **Automation-First GRC approach**:

- **Compliance Automation**: Utilizing platforms like Vanta or Drata for continuous control monitoring.

- **AI-Assisted Auditing**: Leveraging LLMs for policy-to-control mapping and automated evidence collection.

- **SIEM/SOAR**: Integrating risk alerts into automated remediation workflows to reduce Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR).
