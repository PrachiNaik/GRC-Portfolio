## ⚖️ Technical & Ethical Disclaimer

### AI-Assisted Development
This portfolio was developed following the **"Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL)** principle. While Generative AI tools were utilized to assist with document structuring, Markdown formatting, and boilerplate generation, the following governance standards were applied:

1. **Human Oversight:** All risk assessments, policy clauses, and control mappings were reviewed, edited, and validated by me to ensure accuracy and alignment with current 2026 standards (ISO 42001, EU AI Act).
2. **Fact-Checking:** AI-generated frameworks were cross-referenced against official sources (e.g., OWASP, NIST, and ISO) to mitigate the risk of "hallucinations" or outdated information.
3. **Data Privacy:** No sensitive, proprietary, or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data was used in the prompts or processing of this repository.

### Professional Integrity
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to **govern** AI systems. By utilizing AI to build these governance artifacts, I am demonstrating a practical application of **AI-Augmented GRC**, showing how emerging tech can be harnessed securely and ethically to improve organizational efficiency.
